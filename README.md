# DSA with C++ Learning Journey

Welcome to my GitHub repository where I am documenting my daily progress as I learn **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** with **C++**.

## What Am I Doing?

I am consistently practicing DSA concepts by solving problems and uploading my code to this repository. My focus areas include:

1. **Daily Problem Solving:** Practicing different DSA topics and coding challenges each day.
2. **Pattern Printing:** Mastered patterns like Star Triangle, Number Triangle, and Binary Triangle.
3. **C++ Basics:** Covering loops, conditionals, functions, and recursion in C++.
4. **Data Structures:** Learning arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, and more.
5. **Algorithms:** Implementing sorting, searching, and recursive algorithms.
